### INGREDIENTS

* 4 (6-ounce) cod fillets or other flaky white fish
* Kosher salt
* 2 tablespoons canola or vegetable oil
* 1 large shallot, thinly sliced
* 2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
* 1 (2-inch) piece ginger, peeled and cut into thin matchsticks
* 1 fresh Thai or Serrano chile, thinly sliced
* 2 (13 1/2-ounce) cans coconut milk
* 1 ½ teaspoons fish sauce
* 1 teaspoon light brown sugar
* About 7 ounces baby bok choy, ends trimmed and stalks separated
* ¼ cup roughly chopped cilantro, both leaves and tender stems
* 2 tablespoons thinly sliced scallion greens
* Lime wedges (from 1 lime), for serving
* Flaky salt (optional)

### PREPARATION

1. Season fish well with salt. In a large sauté pan, heat oil over medium heat. Add shallot, garlic, ginger and chile, and cook, stirring often until they become translucent, about 2 minutes. Season with salt.
2. Add coconut milk, fish sauce and brown sugar, and whisk together until combined and sugar dissolves. Bring mixture to a gentle simmer. Add cod fillets and turn the heat down to low. Cover and cook until cod is just cooked through and opaque, about 6 to 8 minutes. Carefully remove the fish and plate in bowls.
3. Add bok choy to the coconut milk broth and turn heat to medium-low. Cook bok choy until leaves are wilted and stems are tender, about 1 to 2 minutes.
4. Divide bok choy evenly alongside the fish and ladle the coconut milk broth over each portion. Top with cilantro, scallions and a good squeeze of lime, and serve with remaining wedges on the side. Garnish with flaky salt, if desired.
