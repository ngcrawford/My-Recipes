## Ingredients

- 295 g Milk, whole, divided
- 74 g Butter, salted
- 50 g Brown sugar 
- 100 g Egg, divided
- 7 g Active dry yeast
- 450 g Bread flour
- 8 g Salt, kosher

## Heat milk, salted butter, and brown sugar

- 250 g Milk
- 74 g Butter, salted
- 50 g Brown sugar 

Combine 250 g of milk with butter and sugar in a pot. Heat to 110 °F / 43 °C, stirring until melted.


## Transfer to stand mixer; add egg and yeast

- 55 g Egg
- 7 g Active dry yeast

Pour heated liquid into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment. Add 55 g of egg, and yeast, and mix on medium speed until incorporated.

TIP: Whisk the eggs for easier weighing.

## Incorporate flour and salt

- 450 g Bread flour
- 8 g Salt, kosher

Sift flour and salt together. On medium speed, gradually incorporate them into the mixture.

## Change to dough hook; mix

Change stand mixer attachment to dough hook. Mix until the dough is smooth and pulling away from the sides of the bowl, about five minutes.

## Shape and Proof dough

- Cut into 50 g portions.
- Create a ball with each portion: fold the corners into the middle, exposing a fresh outer surface. Roll until the ball is smooth.
- Place portioned dough in a lightly greased casserole pan or dutch oven. Rolls should just barely be touching.
- Cover and let stand at room temperature until doubled in size. It can take one to five hours for the dough to proof, as temperature affects fermentation activity.

## Preheat oven to 350 °F / 177 °C

## Egg wash

Make an egg wash: whisk equal parts egg and milk, and pass though a strainer.

Brush onto rolls. Take care not to puncture or crush the soft rolls.

## Bake
- Bake covered for 20 minutes, or until the core temperature reaches 190 °F / 88 °C.
- Remove cover and continue baking until golden brown, 5 to 15 minutes.
