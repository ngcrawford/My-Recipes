# Michelada

## INGREDIENTS:

- [ ] 1 12-oz bottle or can Mexican beer (I like Dos Equis or Bohemia, but really anything will work)
- [ ] .5 oz Lime juice
- [ ] 2 dashes, or 5 drops, Worcestershire sauce
- [ ] 2 dashes, or 5 drops, Mexican hot sauce, such as Tapatio
- [ ] 2 dashes, or 5 drops, Liquid Maggi seasoning or soy sauce
- [ ] 1 teaspoonful finely minced White onion (Optional)
- [ ] .5 oz Mezcal, such as Vida or El Buho (Optional)
- [ ]  Mix of salt and powdered chiles to rim the glass (Optional)
- [ ]  Glass: Beer mug or a pint glass

## DIRECTIONS:

1. Put the lime juice, spices and, if youâ€™re using it, mezcal into either a glass beer mug taken straight from the freezer or a pint glass full of cracked ice. (Either vessel can be rimmed with salt or salt and chiles in advance; simply wet the outer rim with a wedge of lime and roll it in the salt or mix).
2. Slowly pour in the beer. Chill.

**Helpful Hint:** 

For parties, I like to bottle up the mix, using 12 oz each of lime juice and mezcal and spices in proportion, and put it and a 1-oz jigger next to a bucket of ice and one of those 5-liter supermarket kegs of beer. (Heineken works fine.) Fill solo cup with ice, add an ounce of mix and fill with beer. Life is good.
