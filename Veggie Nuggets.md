Serves: Makes 25 nuggets
 
### Ingredients
- 1 cup shredded carrots
- 3 cups broccoli florets
- 1 garlic clove
- 2 eggs
- 1¼ seasoned breadcrumbs, divided
- ¾ cup shredded cheddar cheese
- ½ teaspoon onion powder
- ½ teaspoon black pepper
- 1 tablespoon canola oil

### Instructions
1. Shred carrots (I use my food processor's shredding attachment).
1.Steam broccoli in the microwave for two minutes or until tender.
1.Place shredded carrots, steamed broccoli, garlic, eggs, 1 cup of the breadcrumbs, cheese, onion powder, and black pepper in food processor and pulse for 15 seconds or until well combined. Mixture should form easily into a ball. If it's too crumbly, add water one teaspoon at a time until you achieve the desired consistency.
1. Form mixture into balls, about a tablespoon each (I use a cookie scoop). You should get about 25 nuggets. Flatten slightly into round discs about ½-inch thick.
1. Place remaining ¼ cup breadcrumbs in a shallow dish. Coat each veggie nuggets with breadcrumbs.
1. Heat oil in a skillet on medium high heat until it sizzles when sprinkled with water droplets.
Arrange nuggets in skillet and cook about 4 minutes each side, or until golden brown and crispy.
1. Serve with honey-mustard sauce, ketchup, or other favorite dip.
