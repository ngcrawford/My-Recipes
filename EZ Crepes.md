### INGREDIENTS

* 1 vessel whole raw eggs
* 1 vessel all-purpose flour
* 1 ¾ vessel whole milk
* ¼ vessel melted sweet butter
* A dash to a pinch of salt.

### PREPARATION

1. Beat the eggs. Add the rest of the ingredients, and whisk. Add a bit of salt, and taste. If you don’t want to taste the eggs raw, heat a pan, drizzle a bit of the batter into it, then taste it cooked.
2. Heat a nonstick pan, or put a lightly oiled one over medium heat. Add a ladleful of batter, just enough to thinly coat the bottom of the pan. Cook until the edges just begin to brown, probably about 30 seconds. Flip — this is not at all delicate, though it seems as though it should be — and cook about 10 seconds.
3. Cook as many crepes as you want, stacking them on a plate and covering them with a cloth towel until you’re ready to eat. Serve with a whole array of things you might like to put in them.
