- [ ] 4 ripe bananas
- [ ] 1/3 cup coconut oil
- [ ] 3/4 cup sugar
- [ ] 2 large eggs
- [ ] 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- [ ] 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
- [ ] 1 teaspoon baking soda
- [ ] 1 teaspoon ground  cinnamon
- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon salt
- [ ] Optional: 1/2 cup dark chocolate chips

1. Preheat the oven to 350 F. Grease a 9 x 5-inch loaf pan, or spray with cooking spray.
2. Place the bananas in a large mixing bowl and mash them with a fork. Add the coconut oil and sugar to the bananas, and beat with a fork or an electric mixer until smooth.
3. Beat in the eggs and vanilla.
4. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt.
5. Gradually add the flour mixture to the banana mixture, on low speed with the mixer (or using a rubber spatula or fork) just until well-incorporated, but do not over-mix, which will yield a tough banana bread.
6. Stir in the chocolate chips, if using.
7. Scrape the coconut banana bread batter into the prepared loaf pan.
8. Bake for about 55 minutes until a wooden skewer or a sharp knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes, then turn out of the pan and finish cooling upright on the wire rack.
