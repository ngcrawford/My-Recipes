Epicurious recipe for salmon chowder

- [ ] 2 red potatos per person
- [ ] diced pancetta (optional)
- [ ] butter
- [ ] 1 bunch scallions
- [ ] 2-3 cloves minced garlic
- [ ] 1/2 - 1 bag frozen corn
- [ ] 1 pt cream 
- [ ] salmon (1/4 lb per person, skin removed, cut into largish chunks)
- [ ] ~ 1-2 table spones Instant Mashed Potatos
- [ ] paprika 
- [ ] salt
- [ ] pepper

1. Cut red potatoes into 1/2 inch cubes and boil until softened. Set aside.   
2. [ optional ] Cube some pancetta, maybe 1/4 pound, and cook it in the bottom of a big pot with just enough oil to keep it from sticking. It will get reddish brown and firm, almost crispy.  
3. Saute chopped scallions, garlic and lots of corn (frozen is fine for this -- I use a full package) with the pancetta. Use butter if not using pancetta  
4. When the vegetables are soft, add a pint of cream and enough milk to make soup for everyone.  
5. When it reaches a simmer, put in pieces of salmon.  Say, 2 lbs for 8 people.  Keep the pieces fairly large because they will break up.  
6. Stir in a couple of tablespoons of instant mashed potatoes to thicken the soup in the direction of chowder.  (Much easier than flour or corn starch and nicer too.) Don't add too much to quickly; the potato starch thinkens slowly. 
7. Season with salt,pepper, and a little paprika and you're done ! 
8. The dairy and salmon taste great together -- that's why we have all those recipes for salmon veloute and smoked salmon on cream cheese.  Good luck!
