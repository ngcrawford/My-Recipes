2. Coarsely chop or slice onion and garlic. Add to pot and saut√© until softened. Optionally include jalapeno (sliced).

4. Simmer until chicken cooked and beginning to fall apart (30 min)
5. Remove chicken from pot. Raise heat slightly and reduce by half
6. Shred chicken, make crema & slaw, drink a beer, etc.
