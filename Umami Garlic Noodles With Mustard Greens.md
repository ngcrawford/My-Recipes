## INGREDIENTS
- [ ] 4  large garlic cloves, finely grated or minced
 Kosher salt, as needed
- [ ] 10  ounces dried Chinese wheat noodles or Japanese ramen
- [ ] 1  tablespoon oyster sauce
- [ ] 2  teaspoons fish sauce
- [ ] 1  teaspoon cornstarch
- [ ] ½  teaspoon monosodium glutamate (MSG), or use 1/2 teaspoon chicken stock base or 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
- [ ] ½  teaspoon granulated sugar
- [ ] 5  tablespoons salted, European-style (cultured) butter
- [ ] 10  ounces sliced shiitake or cremini mushrooms
- [ ] 1  large bunch mustard greens, stems and leaves, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces
- [ ] Freshly ground black pepper
- [ ] 1  tablespoon minced shallot
- [ ] Chopped cilantro, for serving


## PREPARATION
In a small bowl, cover garlic with 1 tablespoon water. Set aside.
Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil. Cook noodles 2 minutes less than package directions for very al dente. Reserve 3/4 cup noodle water, then drain noodles in a colander, rinse with cool water and set aside.

In a small bowl, whisk together oyster sauce, fish sauce, cornstarch, MSG, sugar and reserved cooking water. Set aside.

In a 12-inch skillet, melt 3 tablespoons butter over medium-high heat. Stir in mushrooms and cook until well browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in mustard greens and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until bright green and just tender, another 2 minutes. Turn off the heat, transfer to a bowl, and season with salt and pepper to taste.

Return skillet to stove (with heat still off) and add remaining 2 tablespoons butter, shallot and garlic-water mixture (do not drain).

As butter melts and sizzles, turn heat back on, to medium-low. Cook, stirring frequently, until garlic is fragrant and some pieces are golden, 3 to 5 minutes.

Stir in cooking liquid mixture and raise heat to medium; bring sauce to a bubble. Using tongs, toss in noodles just until coated in sauce, then turn off heat. If noodles look too thick or taste too salty, add a splash of water. Stir in mushrooms and mustard greens. Let it sit for 1 minute, then serve topped with cilantro.
